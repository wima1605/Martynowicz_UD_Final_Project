            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Universal Design is a progressive approach to creating inclusive environments that can be accessed, understood, and used by everyone, regardless of ability. It emphasizes planning for accessibility from the beginning, as it is far easier and more effective than retrofitting existing spaces, programs, or courses. By considering the diverse needs, preferences, and abilities of people, Universal Design fosters an inclusive environment that benefits everyone. Beyond its social impact, Universal Design makes good business sense and aligns with legal obligations to ensure accessibility. It is a forward-thinking solution that promotes equity and usability in all aspects of society.</p>    </section>

            <h2>Benefits of Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal Design places a human-centered approach at its core, creating environments, products, and services that are user-friendly, accessible, and respectful of dignity, rights, and privacy. By addressing varying degrees of difficulty that individuals face when interacting with features, Universal Design ensures that everyone—whether they experience no challenges or significant ones—can benefit from well-thought-out accessibility and usability. This approach not only enhances convenience but also promotes inclusivity for a diverse population.

                In a rapidly changing world, Universal Design has significant social benefits. As global demographics shift, with populations aging and life expectancies increasing, the need for inclusive design becomes critical. For example, recent data shows a 25% rise in individuals over 80 years of age and an increase in disability prevalence from 15% in 2016 to 22% in 2022. By 2051, Ireland’s population aged 65+ is expected to double, while those available to assist them will decrease. Universal Design addresses these challenges by creating solutions that accommodate people of all ages and abilities, fostering a society where accessibility and usability benefit everyone.</p>   </section>
